# Birdwatcher
A Raspberry Pi project to stare at a bird feeder and take pictures when birds
show up.

## Requirements
* Raspberry Pi.
* Raspberry Pi Camera Card.
* Ultrasonic rangefinder.
* Python 3.2 or later with Raspberry Pi extensions.

## Notes
Birdwatcher uses my albatross library, but git submodule wasn't working on my pi 
properly so it isn't in this repo yet.
